## Technical features

- Image Caching - using NSCache, so that
images wouldnâ€™t be downloaded each time but cached and reused if possible.
- Image Downloading Logic - each cell downloads an image separately and cancels a
task if itâ€™s not needed. In the details view the logic is similar - the images are being
downloaded one by one instead of all at once.
- Pull to refresh - on the main screen there is a possibility to refresh the content by
pulling a table view.
- Logging functionality
- Universal API logic & flow ones

Disclaimer: lots of things inside the code and features could be improved! Some are mentioned in the comments in code for the sample application purposes. Others could be: pagination, more data, etc.
