# Bloom & Wild iOS Test

Hello and welcome to the Bloom & Wild coding exercise!
Please read through the introduction below and complete the task.

Once completed, please share your code either in github repository, or email the zipped
folder to kevin@bloomandwild.com.

If you have any questions along the way feel free to drop Kevin an email too!
 
## The Task

Parse the following API and display the products on the screen-

https://api.bloomandwild.com/v2/availability/products?locale=en&shipping_country_id=1&first_item_in_purchase=true

## The Rules

1. API adheres to JSONAPI (jsonapi.org)
2. Using SDKs / 3rd party libraries is ok with us
3. Itâ€™s up to you how to display the bouquets. It could be a simple list of the name & price of each product
4. Please complete the excerise in Swift
5. There is a basic project strcuture in the repro to help you get going but it's optional for you to use.

## Things we will be looking for
1. Code structure & patterns
2. Scalability/Maintainability
3. SOLID principles
4. Testability (unit tests would be great!)
